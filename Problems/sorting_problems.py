# sorts it and RETURNS the sorted list.  Then sort and print the result
# of the following list.

# sorts it and RETURNS the sorted list.  Then sort and print the result
# of the following list.

# Problem 4 - Efficiency? (10 pts)
# Modify your two functions so that they track the number of times
# you iterate through the big loop, and the inner loop of the sort.  Ask if you have questions.
# Make the functions print each value (times through big loop and inner loop).  
# Run each sort on the list below with the results of the efficiency (loop counts) printed.
