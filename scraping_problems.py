# SCRAPING PROBLEM (12pts)
# Go to your favorite follow on Twitter.  (not someone who posts explicit materials please)
# Inspect the twitter feed in Chrome.
# You'll notice that the tweets are stored in a ordered list <ol></ol>, and individual tweets are contained as list items <li></li>.
# Use BeautifulSoup and requests to grab the text contents of last 5 tweetslocated on the twitter page you chose.
# Print the tweets in a nicely formatted way.
# Have fun.  Again, nothing explicit.
