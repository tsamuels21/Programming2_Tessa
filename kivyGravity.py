# kivy Universal Gravity Calculator (30pts)

# When we learned about exceptions, I asked you to make a Universal Gravity calculator

# G is the universal gravity constant (6.674×10−11 N m^2 / kg^2)
# m1 is the mass of object 1 in kg
# m2 is the mass of object 2 in kg
# r is the distance between the two objects in meters (center to center distance)
# F is force in Newtons 
# F = G * (m1 * m2) / r ** 2

# Make a universal gravity calculator app using kivy
# Your app will have the following:
# -a label widget that shows the title of your app (2pts)
# -a label widget and TextInput to input two masses and the radius (6pts)
# -textInput widgets should not accept non-numerical input. (2pts)  
# -a calculate button to execute the gravity calculation (3pts)
# -answer label to show the calculation after you click on the button (3pts)
# -when calculate button pressed, the answer appears in the answer label (5pts)
# -value errors, and divide by zero errors do not occur (4pts)
# -answer is formatted in scientific notation to two decimals (2pts)
# -layout is formatted in a meaningful way to make application user friendly and attractive (3pts)
